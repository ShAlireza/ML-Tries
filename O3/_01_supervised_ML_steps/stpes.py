    The five main steps that are involved in training a supervised
    machine learning algorithm can be summarized as follows:
"""

steps = """    
    1. Selecting features and collecting labeled training examples.
    
    2. Choosing a performance metric.
    
    3. Choosing a classifier and optimization algorithm.
    
    4. Evaluating the performance of the model.
    
    5. Tuning the algorithm.
